# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project is part of the **alx-backend-python** curriculum. It focuses on writing effective unit and integration tests using Python's `unittest` framework along with tools like `parameterized` and `mock`.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply the difference between unit tests and integration tests
- Write tests to validate the behavior of functions
- Use `parameterized` to test functions with different inputs
- Use `mock` to simulate external calls and isolate code
- Test functions that raise exceptions
- Organize and run Python tests
